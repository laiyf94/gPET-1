## Statement

This is a GPU-based MC simulation package dedicated for PET simulation, co-developed by reseachers from Dr. Xun Jia's group in the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Dr. Yujie Chi's group in the University of Texas at Arlington. For more details or for citation, please refer to the following publication:
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ab5610/meta   
Caution: In this released version, double precision floating-point numbers are employed for recording time in the entire simulation, including those computations on the GPU-end, to improve accuracy. Correspondingly, the time cost for the simulation is expected to be longer than that reported in the paper listed above.

## Hardware and software requirement

To run the code, a single GPU card supporting CUDA platform is required to be installed.
We have compiled gPET successfully on
- Centos 7 with kernel 3.10.0
- Ubuntu 18.04 with kernel 4.15.0

with CUDA version 10.0. The compilation should also work for CUDA version later than 5.0.

## Usage

### Compilation

```bash
nvcc -dc *.cu
nvcc *.o ./kernal/*.o -o gPET
```

### Execution

```bash
./gPET input_PET.in
```

## Package organization

The gPET package is organized in the following structure:

```
/root folder
  “*.cu” files,  for programming function definition and logic flow control;
  “*.h” files,  for programming function declaration and global memory definition;
  “*.in” file, for the entire simulation configuration
  /input folder, for all user input files, including source, phantom, detector configurations, etc.;
  /data folder, for all predefined, code-running-critical data, e.g., material data, cross section, etc.;
  /output folder, for simulation outputs.
```

The main functions of the code files are as follows. “Constants.h” file defines global constants. “gPETInternal.h” defines all global variables used in the host while “gPET_kernals.h” defines that for the device. The “externCUDA.h” file gives all extern declarations. “gPET.h” file then defines all struct data types and declare functions for both host and device. “main.cu” file contains the main function of the package. “iniDevice.cu”, “initialize.cu” and “detector.cu” contain main initialization functions for device, source and phantom, and detector, respectively. “detector.cu” also defines some other functions related to the detector. In the “gPET.cu” file,  the simulation process is defined. All GPU kernel functions are then wrapped into the “gPET_kernals.o” file. 
A simulation example for a small animal PET detector is given in this released version, with the specific configuration seen in the "input_PET.in"  text file. The general units for input of length, energy and time are cm, eV and s, respectively.

## Input file preparation

### (1). Phantom

The user defined phantom information is read into the code through the “void loadPhantom(**)” function in the “initialize.cu” file.
The "mat.dat" is an int32-type binary file, containing the material index in voxelized geometry, following the index list in ./data/*matter file. Notation: the index starts with ‘0’.
The "den.dat" is a float32-type binary file, containing material density in the same voxelized geometry as that used for the "mat.dat" file.

### (2). Source

The user defined source information is read into the code through the “readSource(**)” and “readParticle(**)” function in the “initialize.cu” file.
The source files are of two types, text or binary.
The "source.txt" is a text file, containing the source information for the position emission nuclei, in a voxelized geometry. Source indexes are defined based on that in the “./data/isotopes.txt” file.
The "psf.dat" is a float64-type binary file, specifying the gamma or positron source information in the order of location (x, y, z), global time (t), direction (vx, vy, vz) and kinetic energy (e).

### (3). Detector geometry

The “read_file_ro(**)” function in the “detector.cu” file reads the detector information specified in the text file of "config8.geo".
The extension direction of the panel in the local coordinate requires special attention. “+1” (“-1”) represents the extension of the panel parallel (antiparallel) to the unit vector of the local coordinate system.
More details can be seen in the paper listed above.

### (4). Configuration file

See the “main.cu” file to check how to read the information defined in the “input_PET.in” file. Parser is not designed currently. DO NOT add any extra comment lines in this configuration file.
